Lab 03
In this lab we covered the following things:
    - Installed Flask, and MySQL for Flask
        -To install Flask MySQL for Flask run the following two commands:
            sudo pip install Flask
            sudo pip install flask-mysql
        -If you are using Python version 3 or higher, use pip3 instead of pip
    - Created a simple web application

The files created in the lab are included on this page.

Don't forget to run the following command when initializing your flask setup (where filename is your python script):
        export FLASK_APP=<filename.py>

To run the flask app the command is:
        flask run
